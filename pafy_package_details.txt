I have found that the `pafy` package has excellent capabilities for retrieving information about YouTube videos, including metadata such as the video's title and duration, as well as details on the available audio streams. It provides a robust and reliable way to extract audio from YouTube videos. As such, I will focus on exploring further how I can integrate it with the YouTube data API to extract audio.
